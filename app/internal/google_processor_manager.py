    """
    This function is based off of the Google Documentation for making a DeployProcessorVersion request.
    The documentation can be found at https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/manage-processor-versions#deploy

    The modification provides TimeoutError handeling.
    TimeoutError regularly occurs so to ensure the processor version is actually deployed
        this function is recursivly called once.
        The potential outcomes are:
            (Most Likely) An immediate error indicating the processor is already deployed
                which then causes this function return the string "DEPLOYED"
            A second attempt to deploy the processor version
                which is this also fails will log the error and return the error message
                from the recursive function call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    RESOURCE_NAME : string
        The string generated from docai_client.processor_version_path.
    timeout : int, optional
        The number of seconds for docai_client.deploy_processor_version to wait before raising a
            TimeoutError. The default timeout value for docai_client.deploy_processor_version
            is 900 seconds. The default is 900.
    _Timeout : bool, optional
        Intended for internal use limiting the recursive call to once. The default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    Error object or string
        Upon failure to deploy the processor version the error object is returned
        Upon success the string "DEPLOYED" is returned.

    Below I added an example for a potential implementation for deploying the processors

    Using docai_client.processor_version_path in the place of docai_client.processor_path
        is supposed to direct the document processing to the specified processor version
        without needing to set the default processor version, which can also be performed
        though the API if needed.
    Something to note is that the current default processor version cannot be identifed
        through the API. Not sure why but the capability was deliberately left out.
